# Human-Health-Care-Action-Detection
Vision-based activity monitoring provides applications that revolutionized the e-health sector. The projects aims to detect Human action related to health care. A  new Human Health care Actions (HHA) dataset is introduced. 

The methodolgy we used for Action detection is similar to the one explain in
